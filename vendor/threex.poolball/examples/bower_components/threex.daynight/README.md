```

Or you can install with [bower](http://bower.io/), as you wish.

```bash
bower install threex.daynight
```

# How To Use It

The day-night cycle is composed of 4 parts:

* the sun sphere: the physical sphere representing the sun
* the sun light: the light projected from the sun
* the sky dom: the sky dom aka what you see above your head during sunny days.
* the star field: the stars field displayed during the night

Each of them may be updated according to current ```sunAngle```

## THREEx.DayNight.SunSphere

It handles the color and moving of the sun sphere. 
First you create it and add it to your scene.

```
var sunSphere	= new THREEx.DayNight.SunSphere()
scene.add( sunSphere.object3d )
```

Everytime you want to update it, pass it the current ```sunAngle```

```
sunSphere.update(sunAngle)
```


## THREEx.DayNight.SunLight

It handles the directional light from the sun. 
First you create it, then you add it to your scene.

```
var sunLight	= new THREEx.DayNight.SunLight()
scene.add( sunLight.object3d )
```

Everytime you want to update it, pass it the current ```sunAngle```


```
sunLight.update(sunAngle)
```

## THREEx.DayNight.SkyDom

IT Handles the sky dom and update its change of colors.
First you create it, then you add it to your scene.

```
var skydom	= new THREEx.DayNight.Skydom()
scene.add( skydom.object3d )
```

Everytime you want to update it, pass it the current ```sunAngle```

```
skydom.update(sunAngle)
```

## THREEx.DayNight.StarField

It handles the stars during the night
First you create it and add it to your scene.

```
var starField	= new THREEx.DayNight.StarField()
scene.add( starField.object3d )
```

Everytime you want to update it, pass it the current ```sunAngle```

```
starField.update(sunAngle)
```




## Handle sunAngle

As sunAngle is asked everywhere, here is a simple way to handle it.

```
// begining position
var sunAngle = -1/6*Math.PI*2;
// the day duraction in seconds
var dayDuration	= 10
// then you periodically update it
onRenderFcts.push(function(delta, now){
	sunAngle	+= delta/dayDuration * Math.PI*2
})
```
