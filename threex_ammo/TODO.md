# Demo Domino
- make a spiral shape for the line of dominoes
  - maybe to do a text in cursive writing
- do trigger by impulse, not by ball throwing
- DONE find textures for the dominoes
- if possible, sounds/particles on collision
- about the dominoes path
    - make it such as you can give the path from a string - how to join the letter
    - or simply make a bspline
    - make a hardcoded three.js line of domino

# Possible task
- throwing some dice, pool, bowling

  - do a cube geometry at first
  - display it
  - make a physic conversion of it
- port the vehicule into your demo
  - threex.ammovehicule.js
- make physics easy to tune with dat.gui
- make vr support

# Plan to import vehicule
- take the three.js demo
- port it bit by bit
