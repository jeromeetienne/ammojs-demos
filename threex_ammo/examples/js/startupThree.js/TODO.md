# How to handle load ?
- could be nice to have automatic loading of the js files
- document.write ? or ajax and then eval ?
  - the less black magick the better
- how to handle that in a multi module-imports ecosystem ?


# TODO
- handle the loading in this funciton
  - document write for now
- have an options parameter
  - like with webvr: true, rayinput: true
  - ammoWorld: true
  - cameraControls : 'type', or even your own controls
    - cameraControls: function contructor(){}
    - cameraControls: false to disable it

# Goals
- seems to be the starting of a boilerplate
- remove the lines which are in all three.js demo
- make it tunable, like with ammo.js or not
- make it easily integrable
